### Hardware
#### STM32F4Discovery board
Initially we kicked off the prototype with the `STM32F4Discovery board` together with the `STM32F4-BB` (this daugher board provides Ethernet). The board is connected to the computer using USB. This connection is used to power up the board, program and debug (through STLINK). `PD5`, `PD6` and `GND` are used as the serial connection (for development and debugging purposes, NSH, etc). An Ethernet cable is connected from the `STM32F4-BB` to the working station.

![](misc/images/IMG_20141030_171923.jpg)

The size of Tinq and NuttX together made us switch into a board with more capacity the STM3240G-eval.

#### STM3240G-eval 

![](misc/images/IMG_20141030_171929.jpg)

The STM3240G-eval board includes additional 2 MB SRAM. In order to set it up, connect the USB (flashing purposes, ST-Link), the Ethernet cable, the power connector and finally a 3.3V USB to serial cable:
![](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Cables/USB-Serial-Cable/USB-Serial-Cable-F/images/USB-SERIAL-CABLE.png)

The `TX`, `RX` and `GND` signals should be connected to `CN4` pins `36`, `35` and `39` respectively.

![](misc/images/IMG_20141030_171934.jpg)

To get a serial console type:
```bash
 sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

(assuming that `/dev/ttyUSB0` is the new device that appears when connecting the USB to serial cable)

### Setting it up

#### Requirements
Install the following requirements:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml2-dev pkg-config picocom screen libusb-1.0-0-dev gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

##### Installing `menuconfig`
```bash
git clone http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/git/kconfig-frontends
cd kconfig-frontends/
sudo apt-get install autotools-dev autoconf gperf flex bison libncurses5-dev libtool
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v
```

##### Installing the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx
cd ros2_embedded_nuttx
rmdir stlink
git clone https://github.com/ros2/stlink
cd stlink
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
cd ..
```

##### Installing openocd
```bash
cd tools
make openocd
cd ..
```

##### Selecting a configuration
For Tinq the one you need to use is:
```bash
cd nuttx/tools
./configure.sh stm3240g-eval/dds
cd ..
```
(alternatively if you work with the STM32F4Discovery board do a `./configure stm32f4discovery/dds
`)

This configurations selects `apps/examples/dds` DDS application.

##### Building

```bash
cd nuttx/
make 
```


##### Programming
To program the board:
```bash
make program
```

The output should look like:
```bash
make program
../tools/openocd/bin/openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg -c "init" -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase nuttx.bin 0x08000000 bin" -c "verify_image nuttx.bin 0x8000000; reset run; exit"

##### Serial console
Using picocom:
```bash
picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```
Using screen:
```bash
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```
The advantage of using picocom is that you can scroll while screen does not offer that option by default.

##### Modifying NuttX
To program the board:
```bash
make program
```

##### Debugging

```bash
cd nuttx/
make gdb_server
```
In another terminal (same directory):
```bash
make gdb
```


##### Rebasing NuttX
This prototype relies heavily on NuttX. It's recommended to rebase the code frequently with the master branch of NuttX git://git.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/git. The following steps show picture how to do it:
```bash
git remote add nuttx git://git.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/git
git fetch nuttx
git checkout master
git rebase nuttx/master
```

##### Memory inspection
We can review the memory consumed by the compiled image by:
```bash
cd nuttx
source tools/showsize.sh nuttx
```

### Threading

As it's implemented in this prototype, an application has at least 6 threads:
- [dds_thread_core](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/blob/master/dds/src/dds/dds.c#L961): thread taking care of having a Domain Participant up and handling all the DDS core aspects
- [A thread for each locator (4)](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/blob/master/dds/src/rtps/rtps_main.c#L851): This prototype includes a udp pseudo-poll implementation that uses a thread continuosly receiving on each locator (asociated with a file descriptor). The content is stored in a ringbuffer and fetched from the `dds_thread_core` thread. 
- application threads: each application can launch its own threads using the NuttX primitives. E.g.: [ROSIMU demo](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/wiki/ROSIMU-demo-(Imu-ROS-msg-type,-lis302dlh-accel)) uses two more threads.

### Running in Linux
NuttX includes a simulator that allows to run the applications (with some resctrictions, refer to [nuttx/configs/sim/README.txt](nuttx/configs/sim/README.txt)) directly in Linux. A simple setup can be achieved through:
```
cd nuttx
make distclean # this is an important step to clean previous builds
cd tools
./configure.sh sim/nsh # make sure you have all the requirements in your Linux machine before compiling (e.g. zlib installed, ...)
cd -
make
./nuttx # you should see the NuttX shell ;)
```

---

*IGMPv2*

NuttX supports only IGMPv2 thereby in order to put force your Linux machine in this mode the following should
be done:
```bash

sudo bash
echo "2" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version
```
If you wish to set if to the default value:
```bash
sudo bash
echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/force_igmp_version
```

```

### ROS Client Library
The [ROS Client Library](rcl/README.md) (rcl) for embedded (implemented under the `rcl` directory) allows to code ROS applications using the ROS 2 API. Refer to [rcl.h](rcl/rcl.h) for a list of functions.

A simple ROS publisher can be coded with:
```c
#include "rcl.h"

int ros_main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* Init the ROS Client Library */
    rcl_init();
    
    /* Create a ROS node */
    create_node();

    /* Init the dynamic types 
        TODO: abstract this code
    */
    init_types();

    /* Create a publisher
        TODO: specify message types, topics, etc.
    */
    create_publisher();

    int i;
    for (i=0; i<10; i++){
        publish("Hola ROS 2, ¿como estás?");
    }
}
```

Refer to the [rcl/README.md](rcl/README.md) for further instructions on how to use the ROS 2 API to code applications.

#### Applications
Applications are coded at `apps/ros`. Refer to `apps/ros/publisher` for an example.

### Communication
- [development discussion](https://github.com/brunodebus/tinq-core/issues/7)

### Limitations

- Current example applications (e.g. the [ROSIMU](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/wiki/ROSIMU-demo-(Imu-ROS-msg-type,-lis302dlh-accel)) demo) publish at about 3 Hz. The reason behind this matter is the 4 threads (one for each locator blocked in a `recvfrom` call) simulating UDP polling (refer to [threading](#threading)). Without these 4 threads (which are needed for DDS communication), the code has proved to be able to publish at up to 50 Hz. This limitation should be address by implementing real UDP `poll()` or `select()` support. Refer to [nuttx official repository/TODO](http://sourceforge.net/p/nuttx/git/ci/master/tree/nuttx/TODO), particularly the `UDP READ-AHEAD?` and `NO POLL/SELECT ON UDP SOCKETS` tickets.
- Reception of packages: As mentioned before, this prototype implements UDP `poll()` using 4 threads (one for each locator) blocked "reading" all the time. If a package arrives and there's nobody reading (the corresponding thread should be scheduled at that time) then the kernel dumps the package. This causes that only "some packages" coming from the publising side will be received and processed properly. This [log](https://gist.github.com/vmayoral/703711a6828105cd34bf) presents the `rosimu_subscriber` application running in the embedded board and receiving packages from the Desktop (running OpenSplice). The `header.seq` should increment by one every time however we are getting `4`, `11`, `19`, `28`, ... 
- Tinq QoS parameters hasn't been tested. There's no guarantee that it'll work.
- In NuttX we can't simultaneously read and write from a socket (refer to https://github.com/brunodebus/tinq-core/issues/7#issuecomment-62443465). Tinq has been implemented with this assumption in mind thereby a set of fixes were applied to make it work.
- The implementation does not support different message types with the same topic name ([issue](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/issues/27)). Refer to the [discussion](https://github.com/brunodebus/tinq-core/issues/7#issuecomment-62636116).
- Tinq implementation does not interoperate with RTI's Connext. Refer to the [issue](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_embedded_nuttx/issues/26).
